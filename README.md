This project is a Netflix Clone built on the **NextJs** framework using **React** and **Tailwind** as the frontend. The website was deployed on [Vercel](https://netflix-clone-pi-rouge.vercel.app/auth). The project's backend uses Prisma and MongoDB as the backend that stores the movie thumbnails and a select number of videos. We also used OAuth and an authentication system to allow the user to create an account and login. Although I could not get the Google authentication to work in production, it was working fine in localhost.

In the first page, the website shows you the authentication page where a user can sign-on using Google or their credentials. They can also create an account. If you are a new user, please create an account.

Upon getting to the home screen, the user can enjoy the view of a movie's poster or short video. 


The user can scroll down and take a look at the list of available movies.

The user can only watch Big Buck Bunny, Sintel, Tears of Steel, and the Elephant movie as I could not load official movies and shows.
